Friend Matching Application

Friend Finder is an application that gives a user a survey of ten questions regarding thoughts, beliefs and values. Scores are on a likert scale ranging from 5(Strongly Disagree) to 1 (Strongly Agree).  A user inputs her name, link to her photo, and then answers the ten questions. Once submitted, the answers are compared to other users in the api list to find the user with the most compatibility. When the program finds that person, their name and photo pops up in a modal.
